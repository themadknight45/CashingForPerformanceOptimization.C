# CashingForPerformanceOptimization.C
1.Implemented cache replacement policies like LRU, FIFO, RANDOM, CLOCK, and OPTIMAL.   
2.Conducted a performance analysis of different policies by comparing the number of page faults with the optimal strategy on varying cache sizes (1 to 100) and varying workloads.   
3.The pdf file contains the problem description and the file frames.c contains the implementation.
