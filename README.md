# CashingForPerformanceOptimization.C
The goal of the project is to implement cache replacement policies like LRU, FIFO, RANDOM, CLOCK, and OPTIMAL and conduct a performance analysis of different policies by comparing the number of page faults with the optimal strategy on varying cache sizes (1 to 100) and varying workloads.
